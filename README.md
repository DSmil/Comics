# ComicsAPI

In this project i didn't had trouble implementing the requierments that you have gave me. I have made a mistake with the formating of the page I have mistakenly used another API that allows you to select multiple formats, so in my code you can see that I have impelemented it that way so you can check that with the functions "HandleAdd" and "HandleRemove" in the header.js file and when you select some genre it goes on the first place in the header because my idea was as you have said in the instructions, the header should be used as Filter so you can have a lot of genres to fiter it is nice when you select multiple of them to jump on the beginning.  

I have also changed a little the design of the cars and made it to look closer to the original marvel page the design you have sent me for the cards it looked a bit older like 2010 i have written you an email to ask about that but i didn't get any reply. The implementation was fun and not difficult.

Because it was a short project i commited it all at once I am so sorry that i didn't saw in the requierments that i need to make more commits in order to enable you to see how I develop it. Once again I am sorry for that if you like my work i can explain you my process of developing it. Thanks for your time and chance you gave me.
